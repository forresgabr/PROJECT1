            <p> Te Papa Tours uses an algarithm that calculates the best route of your tour while taking into account your chosen exhibits and  specified requirements. <br>
                As you're enjoying the exhibits your mobile phone will be  signalling our beacons through bluetooth technology. This allows us to notify you with further information like the oportunity to scan QR codes and experience our displays with audio or simply where the nearest bathroom is. 
            The option to talk to one of our friendly employees is easy to! With just one tap your location is sent to their paiger and within seconds you can ask them your burning questions.

             <H2> WHO IS IT FOR? </H2> 
        <p> Museums shouldn't be a luxury and should always be available to everyone. New Zealand is full of vibrant people and 24 percent of our population are identified as disabled, thats a total of 1.1million.
            Being New Zealand's most popular musuem we are visited by flocks of tourists where a fraction of these people are also disabled. Our goal at Te Papa is to welcome everyone through social inclusion and make it simple for everyone to experience Te Papa at it's fullest.
            <br>
            Through innovative technology we want to make your experience with us as comfortable as possible.
